      </header>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          <strong>I'm a self-taught developer</strong> and I've been playing around with Python and JavaScript for several years now. From writing small scripts for parsing through financial market data; to coding along with courses and building small e-commerce websites; to building my own full-stack, containerized application hosted on Heroku. More recently I've decided to try making a career out of this hobby and break into tech from a non-traditional background.
          <br><br>
          I first became interested in programming as a supplement to another one of my interests: cybersecurity. I've been curious about a career in penetration testing and red teaming, and so I began teaching myself the basics of computer science and networking. I quickly realized that the best hackers are proficient programmers, and from my proverbial "first 'Hello, World!'" I was immediately hooked. As someone who enjoyed and excelled at mathematics and abstraction in school, the problem solving aspect of the craft is incredibly fulfilling. The opportunity to test, maintain, and - especially - build real production software while improving as an engineer and my quality of life is a really exciting prospect.
          <br><br>
          In preparation for this career transition I've recently turned my focus to really familiarizing myself with data structures & algorithms so I can contribute meaningfully to discussions about implementation and architecture, as well as feel more comfortable in my ability to consistently implement optimal solutions. Admittedly, I've taken a longer time than I would've liked to begin exploring careers in this space, but I'm excited to finally start building interesting projects and solving engaging problems.

          <strong>Fantasy Football Draft Board</strong>
          <br>
          This project is a tool for ranking and organizing NFL players for upcoming fantasy football drafts. I want to build something that I can use even if the quality isn't the best, and something that I can't readily find online the way I would like to use it. 
          <br><br>
          The App features user accounts and incorporates a basic login and authorization system so that users can save their changes. The UI also offers the option to drag-and-drop players around the draftboard (needs some refining on mobile) for a smoother experience. Features I plan on adding incrementally include autosave, profile customization, and a notes section for players. I suppose I could show the visual design some more love too...
          <br><br>
          Please reach out to provide feedback on any bugs, UI, and code structure if you decide to engage with the app!

            <h3>React Front End with Redux</h3>
            <p>The front-end is built with React and uses Redux for state management. It incorporates many modern features and common design patterns like hooks and functional components. Sorry about the design, but I focused on the back-end and plan on improving the UI gradually.</p>
