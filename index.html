      <div class="content">
        <p>
          <strong>I'm a self-taught developer</strong> and I've been playing around with Python and JavaScript for several years now. From writing small scripts for parsing through financial market data; to coding along with courses and building small e-commerce websites; to building my own full-stack, containerized application hosted on Heroku. Besides earning credibility in the tech industry, I'd love to contribute to teams building professional applications to really understand the process and gain the confidence to execute on my own ideas.
          <br><br>
          Several years ago I became interested in pursuing a career in cybersecurity, and most of the learning material for beginners recommended learning to code. I quickly started enjoying programming as a hobby for it's own sake, particularly because of the heavy problem solving and abstraction. Initially I had a lot of fun playing with API's for financial market data and sports statistics, and even though I was limited in what I could build the possibilities we're very clear to me and very enticing. I reunited with old friends who are more experienced programmers but equally motivated and began collaborating on more serious projects. Now, as I've developed my skills across a couple of different languages and frameworks, I've grown more confident in my ability to conritbute to a team in a professional role. Earning credibility and a reputation in the tech industry, while also contributing to meaningful work and increasing my earning potential are my main focus.
          <br><br>
          In preparation for this career transition I've gone more in depth into data structures and algorithms so I can contribute meaningfully to discussions about implementation and architecture, and also to be more confident that I can consistently implement optimal solutions. Admittedly, I've taken a longer time than I probably should have to begin exploring careers in this space, but I'm excited to finally start building interesting projects and solve engaging problems.

          <strong>Fantasy Football Draft Board</strong>
          <br>
          <br>
          <a href="https://samueljfuentes.github.io/draftboard-ui/" target="_blank" style="font-style: italic;">Check out a beta version of the app!</a>
          <br>
          <br>
          This project is a tool for ranking and organizing NFL players for fantasy football drafts. I want to build something that I can actually use even if the quality isn't the best, and something that I can't readily find online the way I would like to use it. 
          <br><br>
          The App features user accounts and incorporates a basic login and authorization system so that users can save their changes. The UI also offers the option to drag-and-drop players around the draftboard (needs some refining on mobile) for a smoother experience. Features I plan on adding incrementally include autosave, profile customization, and a notes section for players. I suppose I could show the visual design some more love too...
          <br><br>
          Please reach out to provide any feedback on bugs, UI, and code structure if you decide to engage with the app!

            <p>The front-end is built with React and uses Redux for state management. It incorporates many modern features and common design patterns like hooks and functional components.

        <p><strong>Uncertain economic times are opportunities</strong> for new companies to assert themselves and capture marketshare, and for existing players to consolidate their position. 
        <br>
        - talk a bit about new talent vs existing talent, mention the advantage of new vs;
        - i'm the rare opportunity to hire someone with above average self-awareness (unfortunately), great potential as an engineer and hacker, and excellent communicator
        - as new companies try to assert themselves to capture marketshare, and existing players consolidate their positions as the guards change, why not help your team and secure an advantage at a bargain during these uncertain economic times.
