        <h2>About Me</h2>
      </header>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          <strong>I'm a self-taught developer</strong> and I've been playing around with Python and JavaScript for several years now. From writing small scripts for parsing through financial market data; to coding along with courses and building small e-commerce websites; to building my own full-stack, containerized application hosted on Heroku. Now I'd love to join a development team working on interesting solutions so that I can accelerate my learning and improvement.
          <br><br>
          Several years ago I became interested in pursuing a career in cybersecurity, and most of the learning material for beginners recommended learning to code. Initially I had a lot of fun playing around with API's for financial market data and sports statistics, but I was really motivated by what I might be able to build if I improved. I quickly started enjoying programming as a hobby for it's own sake, specifically for the problem solving and abstraction. I reunited with old friends who are more experienced programmers to discuss and collaborate on some of their personal projects. Now, as I've developed my skills across a couple of different languages and frameworks, I'd love to contribute to a professional development team and take my skills to the highest level I can.
          <br><br>
          In preparation for this career transition I've gone more in depth into data structures and algorithms so I can contribute meaningfully to discussions about implementation and architecture, and to assure I can consistently apply optimal solutions. Admittedly, I've taken a longer time than I probably should have to begin exploring careers in this space, but I'm excited to finally start building interesting projects and solve engaging problems.

          <strong>Here's a breakdown</strong> of some of the skills & frameworks I've learned along the way. This is not an exhaustive list and only includes skills I am most confident I can apply in a professional capacity.

        <p>
          I've also played around with TypeScript quite a bit and I'm very familiar with other common tools and frameworks like Redux, Jest, Express, and Flask. I'm equally comfortable with backend tools like Postman as I am with frontend design tools like Figma. Finally, I'm comfortable with production cycles like continuous integration/continuous deployment and the software development life cycle.

          <strong>Fantasy Football Draft Board</strong>
          <br>
          <br>
          <a href="https://samueljfuentes.github.io/draftboard-ui/" target="_blank" style="font-style: italic;">This would normally link you to a live demo of the app, but I am in the process of migrating databases from Heroku.com to Render.com. The link will be available as soon as the app is live again!</a>
          <br>
          <br>
          This project is a tool for ranking and organizing NFL players for fantasy football drafts. I want to build something that I can actually use even if the quality isn't the best, and something that I can't readily find online the way I would like to use it. As you will quickly see I'm not a great designer, but most of the functionality works as promised with only a few bugs here and there ... so far.
          <br><br>
          The App features user accounts and incorporates a basic login and authorization system so that users can save their changes. The UI also offers the option to drag-and-drop players around the draftboard (although it needs some refining on mobile) for a smoother experience. Features I plan on adding incrementally include autosave, profile customization, and a notes section for players.
          <br><br>
          Please reach out to provide any feedback on bugs, UI, and code structure if you decide to engage with the app!
