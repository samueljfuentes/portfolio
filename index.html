        <p>
          <strong>I'm a self-taught Cybersecurity professional</strong> based in Ontario, Canada. I was born in Montreal, Qu√©bec to Salvadoran immigrants, but I've grown up in London, Ontario since I was a toddler. Growing up I played a bunch of sports including Soccer, Basketball, Volleyball, and Track & Field. I was still really young when I became interested in computers as well, and I was curious enough to learn to partition drives or manipulate firewalls, or to display the hidden files on an Xbox DVD so I could copy the .iso file. Still, I was always intimidated by code or anything else I considered too technical.
          <br><br>
          In school I was consistently a top student, especially in STEM subjects and my goal was to become an Electrical Engineer. But by the end of high school, excessive truancy and a lack of discipline kept me out of the post secondary institutions I wanted. For approximately the next decade, I worked simultaneous full-time and part-time positions in a few different industries like auto service, retail, and business services. 
          <br><br>
          I became more and more desperate to increase my income potential, and the Mr. Robot TV series as well as the Darknet Diaries podcast by Jack Rhydsider inspired me to pursue cybersecurity. I knew I wanted to pursue something technical, and after some initial research into the field I was encouraged by the fact that with a little more effort I could compete for jobs without a university degree, and that certifications seem to be valued a little more than they are in other industries. I learned to code with Python and Javascript, and built some personal projects in both languages; eventually I learned enough about computer science and about security vulnerabilities to start practicing basic penetration testing techniques.
          <br><br>
          Today, I am Security+ certified and actively pursuing my first offensive security certification before trying for my OSCP once I've accumulated the necessary industry experience. I've become way more confident in my cybersecurity skills but I'm eager to properly start my cybersecurity career and really accelerate my development.
          <br><br>
          On a brief personal note, some of my interests and hobbies still include watching and playing sports (although much less effectively); financial markets and trading options (responsibly); listening to audiobooks and podcasts; the beach; and watching anime, movies, TV series, and documentaries. If all of this sounds like someone who would thrive alongside your security team, please reach out!
