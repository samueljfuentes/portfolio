        <p>
          <strong>I'm a self-taught Cybersecurity professional based in Ontario, Canada.</strong> I was born in Montreal, Qu√©bec to Salvadoran immigrants, but I've grown up in London, Ontario since I was a toddler. Growing up I played a bunch of sports including Soccer, Basketball, Volleyball, and Track & Field. I first became interested in computers with Windows 95, and I was curious enough that I eventually learned to partition drives andd manipulate firewalls. Still, I was always intimidated by code or anything else I considered too technical.
          <br><br>
          In elementary school I was consistently a top student, especially in STEM subjects and my goal was to become an Electrical Engineer. But too much truancy in high school and a lack of discipline kept me out of the university programs I wanted. For the next decade I worked full-time and part-time positions simultaneously in a few different industries like auto service, retail, and business services. 
          <br><br>
          Eventually I became focused on developing my career skills and I knew I wanted to focus on something technical. At the time I was listening to cybersecurity podcasts mostly as entertainment, but after some initial research into the field I was encouraged to learn that many other cybersecurity professionals do not have post-secondary education either. I started learning to code with Python and Javascript, and built some personal projects in both languages. Eventually, through my self-study I learned enough about computer science and about security vulnerabilities to start practicing basic penetration testing techniques.
          <br><br>
          Today, I've earned my Security+ certification and I'm pursuing other professional certifations like AWS Certified Security and OSCP while I continue to improve my hacking abilities. I'm also studying part-time for an Undergraduate Certificate in Applied Cybersecurity from McGill University improve my professional prospects by obtaining academic credentials to supplement my professional ones. I've become more confident in my skills but I'm eager to properly start my cybersecurity career and really accelerate my development.
          <br><br>
          Some of my other interests and hobbies still include watching and playing sports; financial markets and trading derivatives; listening to audiobooks and podcasts; and watching anime, movies, TV series', and documentaries. If I sound like someone who would thrive alongside your security team, please reach out!
